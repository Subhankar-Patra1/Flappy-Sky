**Flappy Sky** is a beautiful, responsive, and addictive arcade game built entirely with vanilla JavaScript and the HTML5 Canvas API. Experience smooth gameplay, dynamic weather transitions, and satisfying physics as you navigate the sky!

## ✨ Features

*   **🎨 Dynamic Visuals:** Watch the sky transition from a bright **Day** ☀️ to a warm **Sunset** 🌅 and finally to a starry **Night** 🌙 as you progress.

    *   **Desktop:** Spacebar, Arrow Up, 'W' key, or Mouse Click.
    *   **Mobile:** Tap anywhere on the screen.
*   **🔊 Procedural Audio:** No external assets! All sound effects (jumps, scores, crashes) are synthesized in real-time using the **Web Audio API**.
*   **✨ Polish & Juice:** Particle effects for jumps and collisions, floating score text, and smooth animations.
*   **📈 Progression:** The game gradually increases in speed as you survive longer.
